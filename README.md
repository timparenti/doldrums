* "Well, that's the earliest the sun will set.  At least it gets better from here."

* "Whoa, it's kinda still light when I leave the office now."
* "Actually, each day's already two whole minutes longer than the last."
* "Oh, hey, it's not completely dark when I wake up, either."

...and before you know it, it's spring.
